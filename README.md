# ThetaHDR
Theta HDR: utility to capture HDR spherical panoramas using Ricoh Theta cameras on Linux.
The utility was developed and tested with a Theta V connected via USB. 
Pull requests to make it compatible with PTP over WiFi or other versions of the camera are very welcome.

## Dependencies
The utility uses gphoto2 which talks to the Theta camera by means of the PTP protocol. 
Some very useful information is found here: http://codetricity.github.io/theta-s/usb.html
